Redmine API client bundle for Symfony
===================

Symfony PHP wrapper for Redmine API :

* Based on [kbsali/php-redmine-api](https://github.com/kbsali/php-redmine-api/) (dependency usage)
* Add caching management (persistent/files and non persistent/memory)
* Manage Symfony console logging for CLI scripts
* Add extra class for generic/extra Redmine endpoints (ex: for usage of custom endpoints from Redmine plugins)
* Add extra utils/methods, to facilitate common collections management (ex: Custom fields)

### Current state of the project & roadmap

Originally indented to be used for a single project, the independent packaging is a work in progress.

The bundle in actually still focusing on Symfony 3.4.x. further version support will come later.
